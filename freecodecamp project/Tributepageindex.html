      <h2><strong>Here's a timeline of Rev. Ravi's life:</strong></h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1946</strong> -
    Zacharias was born on the 26th of March,1946 in Madras, India. His family moved to Delhi when he was  young and he grew up there.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>1966</strong> - He immigrated with his family to Canada, earned his undergraduate degree from the Ontario Bible College in 1972 (now Tyndale University) and his M.Div. from Trinity International University in 1976.</li>
        <li><strong>1972</strong> -
    He married Margaret Reynolds, whom he met at his church's youth group. They had three children, Sarah, Nathan and Naomi. He lived in Atlanta, Georgia.</li>
        <li><strong>1983</strong> - 
    Spoke in Amsterdam at the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association's first International Conference for Itinerant Evangelists. After Amsterdam, Zacharias spent the summer evangelizing in India, where he continued to see the need for apologetic ministry, both to lead people to Christ and to train Christian leaders.</li>
        <li><strong>1984</strong> - Ravi Zacharias International Ministries was founded in Toronto, Canada. Today its headquarters are located in the suburbs of Atlanta, Georgia.</li>
        <li><strong>1990</strong> - He wrote his first book, A Shattered Visage: The Real Face of Atheism.</li>
        <li><strong>2011</strong> - 
    Canadian Lori Anne Thompson and her husband sent a demand letter to Zacharias requiring him to pay $5 million in exchange for them refraining from filing a lawsuit that would have accused Zacharias of impropriety involving an exchange of texts between Lori Anne Thompson and Zacharias. She had texted nude photos of herself to Zacharias. In response, Zacharias filed a RICO lawsuit against Thompson accusing the couple of trying to extort money from Zacharias. The case was settled in November 2017 with a non-disclosure agreement. In a 3 December 2017 statement, Zacharias said, "Let me state categorically that I never met [Thompson] alone, publicly or privately. The question is not whether I solicited or sent any illicit photos or messages to [her]—I did not, and there is no evidence to the contrary—but rather, whether I should have been a willing participant in any extended communication with a woman not my wife. The answer, I can unequivocally say, is no, and I fully accept responsibility." Zacharias added that he had been "absolutely faithful" to his wife Margie throughout their marriage, but acknowledged that he "failed to exercise wise caution and to protect [himself] from even the appearance of impropriety…"</li>
        <li><strong>2014</strong> -
    Zacharias republished his book: The Lamb and The Fuhrer, an imaginary conversation between Adolf Hitler, Jesus Christ and Dietrich Bonhoffer, as a graphic novel.</li>

    According to the public Form 990 tax return, Zacharias and his wife reported earning a combined total of $523,926 from his non-profit Ravi Zacharias International Ministries (RZIM).</li>
